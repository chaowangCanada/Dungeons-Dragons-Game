MEï¼š About build1, I'd like to verify with you that if all the characters(both ourselves and enemies ) and items should be the exact same level as the map's?

Professor:  The map itself does not have a level. Rather, it is the map is adapted to the level of the character that enters it.


ME:  For example, I created a character of the level two, then if it can only wear the level two's items,

Professor:  I have never mentioned that there should be a restriction on what items level a character can wear.

ME:  only enter the maps of level two, and only fight with the same level's enemies? Is it correct? But what happened, if it passed the level two's map and ready to enter the third level. In this case, all his items and enemies will also update to the third level?

Professor:  Again, the map itself does not have a level. Rather, it is the map is adapted to the level of the character that enters it.

That being said, there is no requirement in build 1 for a character entering a map. Build 1 is only about creating characters, items, maps, and campaigns
